# 📂 File Explorer Traversal – Recursive vs Iterative

An interactive web application that demonstrates **recursive vs iterative tree traversal** for file systems.
Users can visualize how traversal algorithms work, compare performance metrics, and explore execution steps in real time.

## 🚀 Live Demo

👉 [View Project on GitHub Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/Sudhu04/File-Explorer-Easy/tree/main/FileExplorer?file=%2Findex.html)
*(The link will work after you deploy via GitHub Pages — see instructions below.)*

## 📸 Features

* 🔀 **Algorithm Toggle** – Switch between Recursive and Iterative traversal.
* ▶️ **Execution Controls** – Start, pause, and reset traversal.
* ⏱ **Speed Control** – Adjust execution speed.
* 📊 **Performance Metrics** – Compare execution time, total steps, depth, and memory usage.
* 🧾 **Execution Log** – See detailed logs of traversal actions.
* 🗂 **Tree Visualization** – Watch nodes change state (visited, current, pending).
* 🖥 **Code Comparison** – View both recursive and iterative code implementations side by side.
